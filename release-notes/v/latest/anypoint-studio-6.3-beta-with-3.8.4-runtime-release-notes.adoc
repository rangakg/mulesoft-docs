== What's New

This beta release is part of our Crowd Release for Anypoint Platform, with support to our new Design Center and Anypoint Exchange. Crowd Release introduces our brand new Exchange v2.0 and more easy-to-use and powerful API Designer in Design Center. We have updated Studio to support our upgraded platform, and integrate with them for a seamless development cycle. +
These include:

* Import RAML files from our brand new API Designer (beta) in Design Center into Studio 6.3 beta through a new feature called “Import from Design Center”. Please note that for customers who use legacy API designer inside API Manager, the existing APISync feature in Studio will continue to function, and allow users to conduct two-way syncs between the local RAML file and the one hosted on API Manager. The new “Import from Design Center” feature does not support two-way syncs.
* Publish a mule project from Studio directly to our newly launched Exchange 2.0, through a new feature called “Publish to Exchange”

In addition, Studio 6.3 continues to deliver quality improvements and bug fixes.

== Known Issues

* For all users adopting new API Designer in Design Center, Studio 6.3+ Studio versions prior to 6.3 will not be able to import RAML project folders from new API Designer in Design Center. When attempting to import a zip folder downloaded from new API Designer in side Design Center, users will not see any error message, but import will fail.
* Publishing assets to Exchange inside Studio 6.3 beta only works with Exchange 2.0. If a user configures the url to exchange under preference to Exchange 1.0 url, assets will still be published to Exchange 2.0.
* Studio 6.3 does not support the following Mule 3.8 features:
** RecordVars and record payload should be editable in a commit block.
** Object Store support gaps around Idempotent Redelivery Policy, Aggregators and DevKit token manage
* Create JSON metadata from example does not support Big Integers
* When importing a zipped project related to the API Gateway's default domain (for example, proxies generated from API Platform), if the domain project does not exist in the workspace already, there is a chance that it will be generated incorrectly, resulting in an entry in the Package Explorer like "api-gateway_2_0_3 : ". The workaround is to delete the corrupt domain project and right click in the imported project -> Mule -> Associate with API Gateway domain, until the project is generated correctly displaying, for example, "api-gateway_2_0_3 : api-gateway".
* When changing API Platform environments from production to another environment, Studio would try to update offline projects, showing connection error marker. The workaround is to use different workspaces for each environment so that there will no be problem with users authentication.
* Folder decorators are not being shown correctly when users eliminate them. It shows them as modified and not as eliminated.
* When creating a new project with an invalid raml zip, Studio does not copy those files to the workspace.
* API Custom Policy Editing is a beta feature. We have a few known gaps.
* When having some projects connected to the Platform and using an invalid On Premises URL, two error messages per project will be thrown. This issue will be fixed in 6.2.1 (STUDIO-8541)


[[migration]]
== Migration Guide

Users running Studio 6.0 can update to this new version directly from the Studio link:/anypoint-studio/v/6/studio-update-sites[Update Site]. +
If you are running an older version than Studio 6.0, you need to download a new full copy in order to update.

When opening a previous Workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project.

[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.

Then specify the location of your old version of Anypoint Studio in your local drive.
