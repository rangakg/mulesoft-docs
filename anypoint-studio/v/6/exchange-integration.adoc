= Integration with Exchange 2.0 Beta

Anypoint Studio 6.3 Beta allows you to connect to Exchange 2.0 Beta to publish your project as a new asset.

[NOTE]
The Publish to Exchange feature only works in Mavenized projects.

By default, Studio 6.3 Beta points to the Exchange 2.0 Beta URL +https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange2/+.

:: Additionally you can click the "Add Account" button to use a new Anypoint Platform account.

* Group Id: This field is required. The group Id uniquely identifies your project across others. By default, Studio uses the group Id configured in your pom.xml file.
